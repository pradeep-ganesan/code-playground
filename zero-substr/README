Blip:
    Above solution does not account for a very specific edge case where if there
are two consecutive zeroes as substring of a ticket (excluding leading and 
trailing double-zeroes), this algorithm could produce undesired result for that 
ticket. 
For eg, above given solution splits below ticket as
123400456 -> 12 34 0 0 4 5 6 
and fails to pick this ticket as valid due to '0' as a code. 
However, if its split as below
123400456 -> 1 2 3 40 04 5 6
it can be termed as a valid ticket to be picked.
